# WSJT-X Utilities

A collection of scripts & other files to manipulate WSJT-X files. Not a lot here yet!

There is a Python script [here](https://github.com/G1OJS/WSJT-X-and-WSPR-Utilities/blob/main/scripts/Split_ALL.py) that splits the ALL.TXT file into smaller chunks (by month) to make it easier to open with text editiors etc when the file gets large.
